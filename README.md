# Vet-Tech-Tracking-System 
                                       
      
Motivation: This web application was created to transition the SUNY Ulster Vet Tech program from a paper tracking system to an online version. The heads of the vet tech program wanted a way to create new student accounts, and track the degree progress of each student. They're also able to create accounts for each professor in the vet tech program so each can manage his or her own students.
